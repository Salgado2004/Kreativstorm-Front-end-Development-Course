            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <blockquote>"To play a game, to love it is one of the greatest joys of youth...only later do we<br> come to understand that it is one of the greatest joys of life." <em>Jack Nicklaus</em></blockquote>
            <p align="justify">I've been playing volleyball for basically 10 years. I started at school, in physical education class, and it was always a sport that fascinated me because I wasn't so horrible at playing. I never had much coordination in my feet, so I didn't get along with soccer. Volleyball was a sport in which I identified myself and made friends. I participated in volleyball and beach volleyball championships, I lost many but I managed to win some. My competitive career ended in 2020, with the pandemic. But a while later I decided to go back to practice and even gave volleyball lessons to students at my old school.</p>
